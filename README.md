# Face-Mask-Detection-with-CNN-Transfer-Learning
This project explores face mask detection by building a custom CNN model and comparing its performance with a transfer learning approach. It evaluates both models on a balanced dataset and analyzes their generalization ability on real-world images, highlighting the benefits of using pretrained networks for visual classification tasks.
